# Portfolio
This is a brief portfolio of past work for various companies and projects for school.

--ShoeBuck_Sender: this project has had all connections to the existing DB removed.  
                   All stored procedures that were used are now hard coded into the calls to make testing easier for anyone wanting to test this solution.
                   Database.txt will have all of the queries you will need to recreate the tables for testing.

--SeleniumWebTesting: this project was used to test the functionality of the website "https://shoesensation.com" through automation.
                      It will select a category through the navbar, select an item, add that item to the cart, proceed through the checkout page, and stop short of completing the order.
